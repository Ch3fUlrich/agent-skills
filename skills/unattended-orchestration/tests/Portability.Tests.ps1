Adoption test — the one that matters for reuse.

Copies the skill folder into a FRESH git repository, in a directory that has
nothing to do with this one, and drives the whole entry path there **without
editing a single file**:

    -Init  ->  -Validate  ->  -EmitBriefs  ->  -DryRun

If this suite passes, "copy the skill into your repo and go" is a true statement.
If it fails, the skill has re-acquired a dependency on this repository.

    pwsh -NoProfile -File skills/unattended-orchestration/tests/Portability.Tests.ps1

Nothing here launches a session: -DryRun stops before any launch.
