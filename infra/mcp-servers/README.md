# MCP Server Stack — Self-Hosted

A combined MCP server stack for your coding agent (CodeWhale, Claude Code,
Antigravity, …) that reduces token usage by 40–60% on code-heavy tasks through
semantic navigation, disciplined coding workflows, and **structured cross-project
memory**.

Runs on your own hardware with Docker + uv + Node.js. The memory layer is
**Omnigraph** (typed graph + vector + full-text) backed by MinIO — no OpenAI key
required. There is **no fallback memory**: the stack requires Omnigraph (Mem0 was
removed — see [`../../docs/decisions/0001-omnigraph-over-mem0.md`](../../docs/decisions/0001-omnigraph-over-mem0.md)).
For the authoritative overview
see [`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md); for the memory
protocol see [`../../skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md`](../../skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md).

## Quick Start

There are **two composes** with **connected env files**: a `server` (the always-on
memory backend) and a `client` (a developer machine's MCP tools). `.env.shared`
carries the values that link them (`OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN`, `S3_BUCKET`).

```bash
cd ${AGENT_SKILLS_ROOT}/infra/mcp-servers
cp .env.shared.example .env.shared    # OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN + S3_BUCKET (both roles)
cp .env.server.example .env.server    # MinIO creds, embeddings
cp .env.client.example .env.client    # CODE_ROOT, OMNIGRAPH_URL

# SERVER — omnigraph-server + minio + minio-init + omnigraph-init + viewer
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz

# CLIENT — serena (SSE code-nav). Build the stdio graphify image:
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.client \
  -f docker-compose.client.yml up -d
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.client \
  -f docker-compose.client.yml --profile build build graphify
#   Offline (local memory the sync timer reconciles):  … --profile offline up -d

# one-time indexing + register MCP servers into your agent's config (config/*.json):
./scripts/linux/init-serena-projects.sh     # (or scripts/windows/*.ps1)
./scripts/linux/init-graphify-projects.sh
```

See the **[local runbook](docs/OMNIGRAPH-LOCAL-RUNBOOK.md)** (verified setup +
every fix: MCP env vars, `pnpm dlx`, embeddings, compose gotchas),
[`servers/omnigraph/README.md`](servers/omnigraph/README.md),
[`setup/`](setup/) (client/server + offline sync) and

## Active Servers

| MCP Server | Transport | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------|:------:|
| [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) | stdio (`uvx`) | LSP semantic code navigation | Default |
| [Graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) | stdio (`uv` or Docker) | Queryable **code-structure** graph | Default |
| **[Omnigraph](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph)** | stdio bridge → HTTP `:8080` | **Structured cross-project memory** (typed nodes) | Default |
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/erophames/superpowers-mcp) | stdio (`node`) | Disciplined workflow skills — TDD, debugging, planning | Default |
| [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) | stdio (`npx`) | Full browser automation | Default |
| [Context7](https://context7.com/) | stdio (`npx`) | Advanced contextual retrieval and analysis for agents | Default |
| Sentry | stdio (`npx` / Docker) | Runtime error debugging and early error detection ([Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)) | Default (Observability) |
| Datadog | stdio (`npx` / Docker) | Cross-service context for distributed setups ([Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)) | Conditional (Observability) |
| [Omnigraph viewer](servers/omnigraph-viewer/) | HTTP `:8090` | Read-only web UI for the memory graph (tabs, interactive graph, table, search) | Default |

> **Note on Observability MCPs**: Sentry and Datadog require specific token scoping and security configurations. See the **[Observability MCP Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)** before enabling them.

**Vector search** uses a local **Ollama `nomic-embed-text`** embedder (768-dim,
no cloud key), configured in [`cluster/cluster.yaml`](cluster/cluster.yaml); the
`search_decisions($q)` stored query runs `nearest()` over Decision embeddings.

**Clients & offline sync** — online clients point their MCP at the server on
`main`; offline-capable clients run a local copy + a sync timer that reconciles
via a `device/<host>` branch. See [`setup/`](setup/) (`client-setup.sh`,
`omnigraph-sync.sh`).

**Deployed instance (this homelab).** Runs on `coding.vm` from the single-source
`Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml`, exposed via OPNsense/Caddy:
`omnigraph.ohje.ooguy.com` (API, bearer), `omnigraph-ui.ohje.ooguy.com` (viewer,
Authelia), `omnigraph-minio.ohje.ooguy.com` (MinIO console, Authelia). See
[`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md).

## Central vs local: the scripts auto-detect the stack

Two deployments exist and their docker wiring differs. **Local** = this repo's
`docker-compose.server.yml` (compose project `mcp-server` → network `mcp-server_mcp-net`).
**Central** (`coding.vm`) boots from `Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml`
(compose project `mcp-servers` → network `mcp-servers_default`, Dockhand-managed).

The helper scripts no longer assume either. They ask docker what is actually running
(`scripts/_omni_env.py`, and the same `docker inspect` inline in `apply-cluster.sh`):

| Concern | How it is resolved | Explicit override |
|---|---|---|
| Docker network | `docker inspect omnigraph-server` → the network it is attached to; falls back to `mcp-server_mcp-net` when the stack is not on this host | `OMNI_NET=…` · `--network …` (dedup) · `--net …` (split) |
| MinIO store (dedup reset only) | `docker inspect omnigraph-minio` → the mount backing `/data`, **and its type**: a bind mount is cleared with `rm -rf` in a container, a named volume with `docker volume rm` | `--minio-path <dir>` or `--minio-volume <name>` |
| S3 endpoint | `http://omnigraph-minio:9000` — identical on both | `OMNI_S3=…` |
| Token | `$OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN`, else `--token-file` (defaults to central's `.env`), else this repo's `.env.shared` | `export OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN=…` |
| Boot compose | manage central via **its own** compose; this repo's `docker-compose.server.yml` is the local/dev variant (viewer `127.0.0.1:8090` vs central's `0.0.0.0:8090` for Caddy) | `--compose-file …` (dedup) |

`add-project-graph.sh` only rewrites `cluster.yaml`, so it has no host-specific default.

**Both stacks put MinIO on a bind mount** — local at `./data/minio`, central at
`$APPS_ROOT/omnigraph/minio` (`/home/s/apps/omnigraph/minio`). A named volume is therefore
the *unusual* case. This matters because `docker volume rm` against a bind mount is a
**silent no-op**: dedup would restart on a store it never wiped. Detection picks the right
mechanism; if you force `--minio-volume` at a volume that does not exist, dedup now aborts
rather than treating "absent" as "removed".

**Variable-name trap:** `OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID` pins the graph for the **MCP bridge**;
`OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH` is the **viewer** app's variable. They are different — don't swap them.

Check what a host resolves to before running anything destructive:

```bash
python3 scripts/_omni_env.py     # -> network=… bind=…/volume=…
```

Detection reads the **live** stack, which is the point: a declaration is not reality
(see `docs/architecture.md`). Background:
[`../../prompts/omnigraph-align-scripts-to-central.md`](../../prompts/omnigraph-align-scripts-to-central.md).

## Container Registry (Harbor)

To store and share Docker images (like `graphify-mcp` or other custom agents), we use **Harbor**, an open-source trusted cloud native registry. 
*   **Do not install Harbor locally.** It should be hosted centrally on your remote cloud server (e.g. `coding.vm` or a dedicated infrastructure VM).
*   Use it to push images after a local build, and pull them for remote deployments or across different agent workstations.

## Graphify Visualizations
Graphify provides built-in tools to visualize your project graph. After extraction, you can generate:
- **Hierarchical Tree:** `uv run --with graphifyy[mcp] graphify tree` (generates `GRAPH_TREE.html`)
- **Call-flow Diagrams:** `uv run --with graphifyy[mcp] graphify export callflow-html` (generates mermaid flowcharts)
- **Custom Force-Directed Graphs:** Because the graph is exported as a standard `graph.json`, you can use standard Python libraries (like `networkx` or `vis.js` templates) to render interactive physics-based graphs.

## Graphify as a Docker Container

If you don't want a host-level `uv`/Python toolchain, `servers/graphify-mcp/`
builds a Docker image with `graphifyy[mcp]` preinstalled and runs the same
stdio server (`graphify.serve`) — see `servers/graphify-mcp/README.md` for
build, graph-generation, handshake-testing, and registration instructions.
It's registered in `config/mcp-claude-code.json` as `graphify-docker`
alongside the default `uv`-based `graphify` entry (register whichever one
you actually built/want with `register-claude-code-mcp.ps1 -Server
graphify-docker`). Because `graphify.serve` is stdio-only, this is a
`docker run -i --rm` subprocess per session, not a long-running compose
service like `serena`.

## Graphify + Local Ollama — Known Gotchas

Everything below was learned the hard way building graphs for three real
repos on a local RTX 3060. `init-graphify-projects.ps1` and
`patch-graphify-ollama-bugs.py` already encode all of this — read this
section if something still goes wrong, or before changing those scripts.

**The MCP server needs `graphifyy[mcp]`, not bare `graphifyy`.** The
`config/mcp-claude-code.json` template used to omit the extra; the server
would crash on the first request with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'mcp'`. Always test a graphify MCP server change with a raw handshake before
trusting it:
```powershell
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | uv run --with "graphifyy[mcp]" python -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json
```
A working server replies with a `serverInfo` block on stdout, not silence
or a traceback on stderr.

**`extract --backend ollama` needs the `[ollama]` extra too** (`graphifyy[ollama]`,
for the `openai` package it uses to talk to Ollama's OpenAI-compatible
endpoint) — otherwise every chunk fails with *"the 'openai' package is
required for this backend"*.

**graphify's own ollama default model, `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, is not pulled by
anything in this stack** and isn't code you actually want here anyway — it's
a *coding* model, not a *structured-output* model, and the extraction schema
graphify asks for is closer to a function-call/JSON-mode task. In testing,
**`hermes3:8b`** (Nous Research, tuned for reliable tool-call/JSON output)
produced noticeably fewer malformed responses than `qwen2.5-coder:7b` on
identical repos, at a similar ~5GB VRAM footprint. `init-graphify-projects.ps1`
defaults to it and auto-pulls it via the Ollama REST API if missing.

**The default 5-minute client timeout is too short.** `docker logs ollama`
will show `500 | 5m0s` entries for requests that were still legitimately
generating — the client gives up and graphify retries with a smaller,
bisected chunk, wasting the work already done. Use `--api-timeout 1200`
(20 min) for local models; a healthy chunk usually finishes in 5-30s, but a
handful of harder ones can run long even on a good model.

**`--token-budget 6000 --max-concurrency 1`** keeps per-chunk requests small
enough for an 8B-class model to stay coherent, and avoids queuing multiple
requests against a single-GPU Ollama instance that can only serve one at a
time anyway (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` doesn't help if there's only one GPU).

**Local models will still produce plenty of invalid JSON** — expect roughly
30-40% of semantic chunks to get skipped or partially truncated even with a
good model and the tuning above. graphify's adaptive bisection retries and
keeps partial results, so the graph is usable (AST/code-structure data,
which is deterministic, dominates the graph anyway) but not exhaustive on
the LLM-derived semantic layer. Rebuild with a real API-backed model
(`--backend openai`/`claude`/`gemini`/`deepseek` with a key) if you need
higher recall.

**`--force` bypasses graphify's semantic cache, not just the output file.**
A `--force` rebuild always redoes the full LLM extraction pass (can be
~1h per repo on a local 8B model), even if nothing changed. Don't add
`-Force` to `init-graphify-projects.ps1` out of habit.

**graphify v0.9.4 (latest on PyPI) crashes on its own malformed-response
recovery path** in three places — a noisy local model occasionally returns
`"nodes": "some string"` instead of a list of node objects, and graphify's
`.extend()`/`.get()` calls don't guard against that, so the crash happens
*after* a full ~1h extraction pass completes, right at the final write/merge
step. `scripts/patch-graphify-ollama-bugs.py` patches all three sites
defensively (skip non-dict entries, coerce IDs to `str`) directly in the uv
cache; `init-graphify-projects.ps1` runs it automatically before every
extraction. It's idempotent and safe to re-run. These are real upstream
robustness gaps worth reporting to the graphify maintainer, not local-LLM-
specific hacks — the patches don't change behavior for well-formed data.

**uv may extract graphify into multiple different cache directories** — one
per resolved environment, which can differ per target repo if it has its
own `pyproject.toml`/lockfile. The patch script scans and patches every copy
it finds (`uv cache dir` + `archive-v0/*/**/graphify/{__main__,ids}.py`), so
this is handled automatically, but it's why you can't just patch "the"
graphify install once and be done.

## Why a dedicated memory server (not Serena's local memory)?

While Serena includes basic local memory capabilities, **Omnigraph is the designated single source of truth for all cross-session memory in this stack.**

1. **Structure:** memory is written as typed nodes (`Decision`/`Rule`/`Preference`/`Convention`/`Component`/`Task`) that are queryable and reviewable, not free-text blobs — see the [`structured-memory`](../../skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md) skill.
2. **Project Isolation:** each repo gets its **own** graph, pinned per-agent via `OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID`, so a bad write in one project cannot touch another.
3. **Retrieval:** graph traversal + vector + full-text in one engine, with a local Ollama embedder (no cloud key).

To prevent agent confusion and overlapping functionality, Serena's memory tools (`write_memory`, `read_memory`, etc.) are explicitly **disabled** using the `excludeTools` configuration in all provided JSON setup files. Do not re-enable them.

## Playwright — Browser Automation for DeepSeek

DeepSeek cannot browse the web. [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
(34k+ stars, Microsoft) gives the agent full browser automation — navigate pages,
click elements, type text, take screenshots, mock APIs, and run arbitrary
Playwright scripts. No API key required.

**Why Playwright over search-only MCPs:**
- **Real browser** — renders JavaScript, handles logins, submits forms
- **Accessibility snapshots** — understands page structure without vision models
- **Network monitoring** — inspect and mock API responses
- **Storage state** — persists cookies/localStorage across sessions
- **Multi-browser** — Chrome, Firefox, WebKit, Edge
- **No rate limits** — no API key, no quota, runs locally

**Setup:**
1. Playwright MCP auto-installs on first `npx` run. No manual steps needed.
2. Restart your coding agent — tools appear as `mcp_playwright_*` (40+ tools).
3. Try: *"Go to example.com, take a screenshot, and describe what you see."*

**Configuration options** (add to `args` in `mcp.json`):
- `--headless` — run without visible browser window
- `--browser=firefox` — use Firefox instead of Chromium
- `--port 8931` — run as standalone HTTP server
- `--isolated` — fresh session each time (no persistent cookies)

## Token Savings — Evidence

Measured on a moderately complex refactoring task (5 files, 12 symbol lookups),
comparing before/after Serena:

| Metric | Before (file reads) | After (Serena) | Reduction |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `read_file` calls | 24 | 1 | **-96%** |
| Token consumption | ~45K | ~18K | **-60%** |
| Turn count | 18 | 8 | **-56%** |
| Time | ~3 min | ~1 min | **-67%** |

## Per-Repository Starter

To enable MCP servers in a new repository, copy the starter pack from the parent repository:


```
starters/mcp-servers/
```

This installs `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files that teach the agent how to activate
Serena, run onboarding, build a Graphify graph, and use semantic code navigation from the first turn.

## Google Antigravity Setup

For Google Antigravity, configuration is loaded from the global `mcp_config.json` file. A complete, optimized template is provided at [`config/mcp_antigravity.json`](config/mcp_antigravity.json).

### 1. Configuration Location
On Windows, Antigravity reads its config from:
`C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\config\mcp_config.json` (which is symlinked to `C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.json`).

### 2. Tool Filtering (excludeTools)
To prevent agent confusion and tool redundancy (e.g., memory tools exposed by both Serena and Omnigraph), we filter out unused/unneeded tools using the client-side `excludeTools` property:

*   **Serena**: Memory tools (`write_memory`, `read_memory`, `list_memories`, `delete_memory`, `rename_memory`, `edit_memory`) and GUI/setup tools (`onboarding`, `open_dashboard`, `initial_instructions`) are **excluded**, leaving Serena focused on LSP semantic search, refactoring, and project switching. `activate_project`/`get_current_config` are **kept** — Serena runs in multi-project mode (see [`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md)), and excluding those two would strand a session on whichever repo activates first with no way to switch to another.
*   **Superpowers**: All workflow tools are left active.
