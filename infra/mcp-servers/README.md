# MCP Server Stack — Self-Hosted

A combined MCP server stack for your coding agent (CodeWhale, Claude Code,
Antigravity, …) that reduces token usage by 40–60% on code-heavy tasks through
semantic navigation, disciplined coding workflows, and **structured cross-project
memory**.

Runs on your own hardware with Docker + uv + Node.js. The default memory layer is
**Omnigraph** (typed graph + vector + full-text) backed by MinIO — no OpenAI key
required. **Mem0** is retained as an off-by-default fallback (it uses DeepSeek for
fact extraction + Ollama `bge-m3` for embeddings). For the authoritative overview
see [`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md); for the memory
protocol see [`../../skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md`](../../skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md).

## Quick Start

There are **two composes** with **connected env files**: a `server` (the always-on
memory backend) and a `client` (a developer machine's MCP tools). `.env.shared`
carries the values that link them (`OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN`, `S3_BUCKET`).

```bash
cd ${AGENT_SKILLS_ROOT}/infra/mcp-servers
cp .env.shared.example .env.shared    # OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN + S3_BUCKET (both roles)
cp .env.server.example .env.server    # MinIO creds, embeddings, mem0-fallback
cp .env.client.example .env.client    # CODE_ROOT, OMNIGRAPH_URL

# SERVER — omnigraph-server + minio + minio-init + omnigraph-init + viewer
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.server \
  -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
#   Mem0 fallback:  … -f docker-compose.server.yml --profile mem0-fallback up -d

# CLIENT — serena (SSE code-nav). Build the stdio graphify image:
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.client \
  -f docker-compose.client.yml up -d
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.client \
  -f docker-compose.client.yml --profile build build graphify
#   Offline (local memory the sync timer reconciles):  … --profile offline up -d

# one-time indexing + register MCP servers into your agent's config (config/*.json):
./scripts/linux/init-serena-projects.sh     # (or scripts/windows/*.ps1)
./scripts/linux/init-graphify-projects.sh
```

## Active Servers

| MCP Server | Transport | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------|:------:|
| [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) | stdio (`uvx`) | LSP semantic code navigation | Default |
| [Graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) | stdio (`uv` or Docker) | Queryable **code-structure** graph | Default |
| **[Omnigraph](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph)** | stdio bridge → HTTP `:8080` | **Structured cross-project memory** (typed nodes) | Default |
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/erophames/superpowers-mcp) | stdio (`node`) | Disciplined workflow skills — TDD, debugging, planning | Default |
| [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) | stdio (`npx`) | Full browser automation | Default |
| [Context7](https://context7.com/) | stdio (`npx`) | Advanced contextual retrieval and analysis for agents | Default |
| Sentry | stdio (`npx` / Docker) | Runtime error debugging and early error detection ([Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)) | Default (Observability) |
| Datadog | stdio (`npx` / Docker) | Cross-service context for distributed setups ([Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)) | Conditional (Observability) |
| [Omnigraph viewer](servers/omnigraph-viewer/) | HTTP `:8090` | Read-only web UI for the memory graph (tabs, interactive graph, table, search) | Default |
| Mem0 | SSE (`docker`) | Cross-session memory (REST API + pgvector) | Fallback (`--profile mem0-fallback`) |

> **Note on Observability MCPs**: Sentry and Datadog require specific token scoping and security configurations. See the **[Observability MCP Setup Guide](docs/OBSERVABILITY-MCP-SETUP.md)** before enabling them.

**Vector search** uses a local **Ollama `nomic-embed-text`** embedder (768-dim,
no cloud key), configured in [`cluster/cluster.yaml`](cluster/cluster.yaml); the
`search_decisions($q)` stored query runs `nearest()` over Decision embeddings.

**Clients & offline sync** — online clients point their MCP at the server on
`main`; offline-capable clients run a local copy + a sync timer that reconciles
via a `device/<host>` branch. See [`setup/`](setup/) (`client-setup.sh`,
`omnigraph-sync.sh`).

**Deployed instance (this homelab).** Runs on `coding.vm` from the single-source
`Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml`, exposed via OPNsense/Caddy:
`omnigraph.ohje.ooguy.com` (API, bearer), `omnigraph-ui.ohje.ooguy.com` (viewer,
Authelia), `omnigraph-minio.ohje.ooguy.com` (MinIO console, Authelia). See
[`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md).

## Central vs local: script defaults & mismatches

The Omnigraph helper scripts (`scripts/apply-cluster.sh`, `scripts/dedup-graph.py`,
`scripts/split-project-graph.py`, `scripts/add-project-graph.sh`) and this repo's
`docker-compose.server.yml` were tuned against a **local** stack (compose project
`mcp-server`). Their defaults do **not** match the **central** deployment on `coding.vm`,
which boots from `Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml` (compose project
`mcp-servers`, Dockhand-managed). On central, pass these overrides:

| Concern | Script default (local) | Central reality | Override on central |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker network | `mcp-server_mcp-net` (`OMNI_NET` / `--network` / `--net`) | `mcp-servers_default` (project `mcp-servers`, no custom network) | `OMNI_NET=mcp-servers_default` (apply-cluster.sh) · `--network mcp-servers_default` (dedup-graph.py) · `--net mcp-servers_default` (split-project-graph.py) |
| MinIO store (dedup reset) | named volume `mcp-servers_omnigraph_minio` (`--minio-volume`) | **bind mount** `/home/s/apps/omnigraph/minio` (`$APPS_ROOT/omnigraph/minio`); the named volume was removed | `--minio-path /home/s/apps/omnigraph/minio` — a `docker volume rm` is a **no-op** against a bind mount |
| S3 endpoint | `http://omnigraph-minio:9000` (`OMNI_S3`) | same (`omnigraph-server`'s `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`) | none — already matches |
| Env / token | `apply-cluster.sh` sources `.env.shared` + `.env.server`; `split-project-graph.py` reads the same | central token/MinIO creds live in `Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/.env` | make `.env.shared`/`.env.server` resolve to central's values (or `export OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN=…`). `dedup-graph.py` already defaults `--token-file`/`--compose-file` to central's `.env`/compose, but its `--network`/`--minio-volume` are still local |
| Boot compose | `docker-compose.server.yml` (project `mcp-server`, viewer `127.0.0.1:8090`) | `Server/server/coding/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml` (project `mcp-servers`, viewer `0.0.0.0:8090` for Caddy) | manage central via that compose, not this repo's `docker-compose.server.yml` (a local/dev variant) |

**Variable-name trap:** `OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID` pins the graph for the **MCP bridge**;
`OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH` is the **viewer** app's variable. They are different — don't swap them.

To realign the scripts to central — run with the overrides above, or change the defaults to
auto-detect — verify against the live stack first (`docker inspect omnigraph-server` for the
real network, `docker inspect omnigraph-minio` for the MinIO mount). See
[`../../prompts/omnigraph-align-scripts-to-central.md`](../../prompts/omnigraph-align-scripts-to-central.md).

## Container Registry (Harbor)

To store and share Docker images (like `graphify-mcp` or other custom agents), we use **Harbor**, an open-source trusted cloud native registry. 
*   **Do not install Harbor locally.** It should be hosted centrally on your remote cloud server (e.g. `coding.vm` or a dedicated infrastructure VM).
*   Use it to push images after a local build, and pull them for remote deployments or across different agent workstations.

## Graphify Visualizations
Graphify provides built-in tools to visualize your project graph. After extraction, you can generate:
- **Hierarchical Tree:** `uv run --with graphifyy[mcp] graphify tree` (generates `GRAPH_TREE.html`)
- **Call-flow Diagrams:** `uv run --with graphifyy[mcp] graphify export callflow-html` (generates mermaid flowcharts)
- **Custom Force-Directed Graphs:** Because the graph is exported as a standard `graph.json`, you can use standard Python libraries (like `networkx` or `vis.js` templates) to render interactive physics-based graphs.

## Graphify as a Docker Container

If you don't want a host-level `uv`/Python toolchain, `servers/graphify-mcp/`
builds a Docker image with `graphifyy[mcp]` preinstalled and runs the same
stdio server (`graphify.serve`) — see `servers/graphify-mcp/README.md` for
build, graph-generation, handshake-testing, and registration instructions.
It's registered in `config/mcp-claude-code.json` as `graphify-docker`
alongside the default `uv`-based `graphify` entry (register whichever one
you actually built/want with `register-claude-code-mcp.ps1 -Server
graphify-docker`). Because `graphify.serve` is stdio-only, this is a
`docker run -i --rm` subprocess per session, not a long-running compose
service like `serena`/`mem0`.

## Graphify + Local Ollama — Known Gotchas

Everything below was learned the hard way building graphs for three real
repos on a local RTX 3060. `init-graphify-projects.ps1` and
`patch-graphify-ollama-bugs.py` already encode all of this — read this
section if something still goes wrong, or before changing those scripts.

**The MCP server needs `graphifyy[mcp]`, not bare `graphifyy`.** The
`config/mcp-claude-code.json` template used to omit the extra; the server
would crash on the first request with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'mcp'`. Always test a graphify MCP server change with a raw handshake before
trusting it:
```powershell
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | uv run --with "graphifyy[mcp]" python -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json
```
A working server replies with a `serverInfo` block on stdout, not silence
or a traceback on stderr.

**`extract --backend ollama` needs the `[ollama]` extra too** (`graphifyy[ollama]`,
for the `openai` package it uses to talk to Ollama's OpenAI-compatible
endpoint) — otherwise every chunk fails with *"the 'openai' package is
required for this backend"*.

**graphify's own ollama default model, `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, is not pulled by
anything in this stack** and isn't code you actually want here anyway — it's
a *coding* model, not a *structured-output* model, and the extraction schema
graphify asks for is closer to a function-call/JSON-mode task. In testing,
**`hermes3:8b`** (Nous Research, tuned for reliable tool-call/JSON output)
produced noticeably fewer malformed responses than `qwen2.5-coder:7b` on
identical repos, at a similar ~5GB VRAM footprint. `init-graphify-projects.ps1`
defaults to it and auto-pulls it via the Ollama REST API if missing.

**The default 5-minute client timeout is too short.** `docker logs ollama`
will show `500 | 5m0s` entries for requests that were still legitimately
generating — the client gives up and graphify retries with a smaller,
bisected chunk, wasting the work already done. Use `--api-timeout 1200`
(20 min) for local models; a healthy chunk usually finishes in 5-30s, but a
handful of harder ones can run long even on a good model.

**`--token-budget 6000 --max-concurrency 1`** keeps per-chunk requests small
enough for an 8B-class model to stay coherent, and avoids queuing multiple
requests against a single-GPU Ollama instance that can only serve one at a
time anyway (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` doesn't help if there's only one GPU).

**Local models will still produce plenty of invalid JSON** — expect roughly
30-40% of semantic chunks to get skipped or partially truncated even with a
good model and the tuning above. graphify's adaptive bisection retries and
keeps partial results, so the graph is usable (AST/code-structure data,
which is deterministic, dominates the graph anyway) but not exhaustive on
the LLM-derived semantic layer. Rebuild with a real API-backed model
(`--backend openai`/`claude`/`gemini`/`deepseek` with a key) if you need
higher recall.

**`--force` bypasses graphify's semantic cache, not just the output file.**
A `--force` rebuild always redoes the full LLM extraction pass (can be
~1h per repo on a local 8B model), even if nothing changed. Don't add
`-Force` to `init-graphify-projects.ps1` out of habit.

**graphify v0.9.4 (latest on PyPI) crashes on its own malformed-response
recovery path** in three places — a noisy local model occasionally returns
`"nodes": "some string"` instead of a list of node objects, and graphify's
`.extend()`/`.get()` calls don't guard against that, so the crash happens
*after* a full ~1h extraction pass completes, right at the final write/merge
step. `scripts/patch-graphify-ollama-bugs.py` patches all three sites
defensively (skip non-dict entries, coerce IDs to `str`) directly in the uv
cache; `init-graphify-projects.ps1` runs it automatically before every
extraction. It's idempotent and safe to re-run. These are real upstream
robustness gaps worth reporting to the graphify maintainer, not local-LLM-
specific hacks — the patches don't change behavior for well-formed data.

**uv may extract graphify into multiple different cache directories** — one
per resolved environment, which can differ per target repo if it has its
own `pyproject.toml`/lockfile. The patch script scans and patches every copy
it finds (`uv cache dir` + `archive-v0/*/**/graphify/{__main__,ids}.py`), so
this is handled automatically, but it's why you can't just patch "the"
graphify install once and be done.

## Mem0 — Fallback Memory (off by default)

> Omnigraph is the default memory layer (see the top of this file). The Mem0
> stack below runs only under `docker compose --profile mem0-fallback up -d` and
> is documented here for that fallback case.

Mem0 runs as a three-container Docker stack using the official `mem0/mem0-api-server`
image, PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings, and a custom MCP SSE bridge that lets
your coding agent and Claude Code connect without the stdio timeout issue.

### Architecture

└──────────────────┘
```

### Why This Fixes the Old Problem

The previous setup used a third-party MCP server (`mem0-mcp-selfhosted` by elvismdev)
over stdio transport. your coding agent's hardcoded 120-second MCP stdio timeout killed every
`tools/call` before mem0 could respond. The new approach:

- **SSE transport** — the MCP bridge runs as a persistent Docker service with an HTTP
  SSE endpoint. No stdio timeout applies.
- **Official images** — uses `mem0/mem0-api-server:latest` and `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`,
  the same stack documented at docs.mem0.ai.
- **Separation of concerns** — the mem0 REST API handles fact extraction and vector
  storage; the MCP bridge only translates tool calls. If the API is slow, the bridge
  waits (no 120s deadline).

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add_memory` | Store text or conversation as a memory |
| `search_memories` | Semantic search across memories with scores |
| `get_memories` | List all memories for a user |
| `delete_memory` | Delete a memory by ID |
| `health` | Check bridge and API health |

### Quick Verification

```powershell
# Check the REST API
curl http://localhost:8888/health

# Check the MCP bridge
curl http://localhost:8001/sse

# Add a test memory
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/memories `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Test memory"}],"user_id":"your-username"}'
```

### Why a dedicated memory server (not Serena's local memory)?

While Serena includes basic local memory capabilities, **Mem0 is the designated single source of truth for all cross-session memory in this stack.** 

1. **Intelligence:** Mem0 automatically extracts entities, handles summarization, and uses vector search natively. It removes the cognitive overhead of manually formatting knowledge graphs.
2. **Project Isolation:** Mem0 supports strict project isolation natively via the `user_id` parameter (mapping to your repository folder name), which is crucial for preventing memory spillover across different projects.
3. **Reliability:** Mem0 is a production-grade infrastructure layer that reliably persists data and scales.

To prevent agent confusion and overlapping functionality, Serena's memory tools (`write_memory`, `read_memory`, etc.) are explicitly **disabled** using the `excludeTools` configuration in all provided JSON setup files. Do not re-enable them.

## MCP Endpoints

| Server | Access URL / Method |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Serena** | `uvx` stdio — no web UI |
| **Playwright** | `npx` stdio — headed browser, no API key needed ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-mcp)) |
| **Mem0 REST API** | [http://localhost:8888/docs](http://localhost:8888/docs) (OpenAPI), `/health` |
| **Mem0 MCP Bridge** | [http://localhost:8001/sse](http://localhost:8001/sse) (SSE), `/health` |
| **Superpowers** | `node` stdio — no web UI |
| **PostgreSQL** | `localhost:5433` (pgvector, credentials in `.env`) |

## Playwright — Browser Automation for DeepSeek

DeepSeek cannot browse the web. [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
(34k+ stars, Microsoft) gives the agent full browser automation — navigate pages,
click elements, type text, take screenshots, mock APIs, and run arbitrary
Playwright scripts. No API key required.

**Why Playwright over search-only MCPs:**
- **Real browser** — renders JavaScript, handles logins, submits forms
- **Accessibility snapshots** — understands page structure without vision models
- **Network monitoring** — inspect and mock API responses
- **Storage state** — persists cookies/localStorage across sessions
- **Multi-browser** — Chrome, Firefox, WebKit, Edge
- **No rate limits** — no API key, no quota, runs locally

**Setup:**
1. Playwright MCP auto-installs on first `npx` run. No manual steps needed.
2. Restart your coding agent — tools appear as `mcp_playwright_*` (40+ tools).
3. Try: *"Go to example.com, take a screenshot, and describe what you see."*

**Configuration options** (add to `args` in `mcp.json`):
- `--headless` — run without visible browser window
- `--browser=firefox` — use Firefox instead of Chromium
- `--port 8931` — run as standalone HTTP server
- `--isolated` — fresh session each time (no persistent cookies)

## Mem0 Dashboard — Web UI

The self-hosted dashboard runs at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### Authentication

| Mode | When | How |
|------|------|-----|
| **Open access** (current) | `AUTH_DISABLED=true` in `docker-compose.yml` | Dashboard loads without login. All API endpoints are open. Production: set to `false`. |
| **Authentication enabled** | `AUTH_DISABLED=false` | Visit `/setup` to create the first admin account, then log in with email + password. |

### Enabling auth (production)

1. Set in `.env`:
   ```
   ADMIN_API_KEY=<random-string-16+-chars>
   JWT_SECRET=<openssl-rand-base64-48>
   ```
2. Change `AUTH_DISABLED=false` in `docker-compose.yml` (mem0 service `environment:` block)
3. Rebuild: `docker compose up -d --build mem0`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/setup` → create admin account
5. Use `X-API-Key: <ADMIN_API_KEY>` header for admin API operations

### Creating API keys for agents

Once auth is enabled:
1. Log into the dashboard
2. Go to **API Keys** → **Create Key**
3. Give it a label (e.g. "your coding agent")
4. Copy the generated key
5. Pass it to the MCP bridge or REST API calls as `X-API-Key` header

### Default credentials

There are **no default credentials**. The setup wizard at `/setup` creates the first admin account. Until then, with `AUTH_DISABLED=true`, the dashboard is open.

## Token Savings — Evidence

Measured on a moderately complex refactoring task (5 files, 12 symbol lookups),
comparing before/after Serena:

| Metric | Before (file reads) | After (Serena) | Reduction |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `read_file` calls | 24 | 1 | **-96%** |
| Token consumption | ~45K | ~18K | **-60%** |
| Turn count | 18 | 8 | **-56%** |
| Time | ~3 min | ~1 min | **-67%** |

See [TOKEN_SAVINGS.md](docs/TOKEN_SAVINGS.md) for detailed cases.

## Per-Repository Starter

To enable MCP servers in a new repository, copy the starter pack from the parent repository:


```
starters/mcp-servers/
```

This installs `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files that teach the agent how to activate
Serena, run onboarding, build a Graphify graph, and use semantic code navigation from the first turn.

## Google Antigravity Setup

For Google Antigravity, configuration is loaded from the global `mcp_config.json` file. A complete, optimized template is provided at [`config/mcp_antigravity.json`](config/mcp_antigravity.json).

### 1. Configuration Location
On Windows, Antigravity reads its config from:
`C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\config\mcp_config.json` (which is symlinked to `C:\Users\<username>\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.json`).

### 2. Transport Optimization
While your coding agent uses SSE transport for Mem0 to bypass its 120s stdio timeout, Antigravity has native SSE client issues that cause `Method Not Allowed` (405) errors. To resolve this, **Mem0 is run as a stdio process** for Antigravity using `uv run`, connecting to the same running Mem0 Docker containers on port `8888`.

### 3. Tool Filtering (excludeTools)
To prevent agent confusion and tool redundancy (e.g., memory tools exposed by both Serena and Mem0), we filter out unused/unneeded tools using the client-side `excludeTools` property:

*   **Serena**: Memory tools (`write_memory`, `read_memory`, `list_memories`, `delete_memory`, `rename_memory`, `edit_memory`) and GUI/setup tools (`onboarding`, `open_dashboard`, `initial_instructions`) are **excluded**, leaving Serena focused on LSP semantic search, refactoring, and project switching. `activate_project`/`get_current_config` are **kept** — Serena runs in multi-project mode (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), and excluding those two would strand a session on whichever repo activates first with no way to switch to another.
*   **Mem0**: The `health` check tool is **excluded**, leaving only the 4 core memory storage and search tools.
*   **Superpowers**: All workflow tools are left active.
