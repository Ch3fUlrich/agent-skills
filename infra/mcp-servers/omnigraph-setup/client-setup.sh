# The bridge env contract is OMNIGRAPH_BASE_URL + OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID + OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN.
# `OMNIGRAPH_URL` is the VIEWER's variable and does nothing here; a bridge without
# OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID refuses to start (the server is cluster-only). Per-project isolation
# means the graph is per-repo, so this prints a project-scoped .mcp.json rather than
# registering one user-scope bridge pinned to a single graph.
#
# ONE bridge, not two. A second `omnigraph-globals` server on `memory` was removed on
# 2026-07-17: `memory` holds only two global Preferences (TDD-by-default, MCP-first nav),
# which are already Principles 2 and 6 of skills/coding-principles/SKILL.md, so a whole
# extra MCP server to re-serve two lines was duplication — and it listed every omnigraph
# tool twice in the picker.
#
# The docker form is preferred over npx: coding.vm has no node/npx, and docker works on
# every host that runs the stack. OMNIGRAPH_NET differs per host, so probe it rather than
# hardcoding: python3 ../scripts/_omni_env.py
register_mcp() {  # $1=BASE_URL $2=TOKEN
  cat <<JSON
Add this to the repo's .mcp.json (project scope — the graph travels with the repo).
Replace <repo-folder-name> with the repo's folder name; that IS the graph id.
Keep the bearer OUT of a tracked file — reference the env var:

  "omnigraph": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm",
             "--network", "\${OMNIGRAPH_NET:-mcp-server_mcp-net}",
             "-e", "OMNIGRAPH_BASE_URL=$1",
             "-e", "OMNIGRAPH_GRAPH_ID=<repo-folder-name>",
             "-e", "OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN=\${OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN}",
             "omnigraph-mcp:latest"]
  }

Then export these once per machine, before launching the agent:
  export OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN=$2
  export OMNIGRAPH_NET=\$(python3 ../scripts/_omni_env.py | sed 's/.*network=\([^ ]*\).*/\1/')
Unset, \${OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN} resolves to empty and memory silently does not work.
