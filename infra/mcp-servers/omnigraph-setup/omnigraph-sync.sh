# omnigraph-sync.sh — reconcile this client's LOCAL Omnigraph with CENTRAL, per graph.
#
# The Linux/macOS twin of sync-windows.ps1. Both drive the same two Python helpers
# (omnigraph_jsonl.py, pull_graph.py), so the actual reconcile logic exists once.
#
# Per graph:
#   0. BACKUP local main -> backups/local-<graph>-<ts>.jsonl   (before any write)
#   1. VERIFY local for duplicates
#   2. PUSH only the DELTA to central main  (nodes that differ + edges central lacks)
#   3. VERIFY central
#   4. PULL central -> local via pull_graph.py (purge, then load into the empty graph)
#   5. VERIFY local
# One graph failing does not abort the others; the exit code is the last failure.
#
# Why it looks like this — each choice was bought with an incident (2026-07-17):
#   * DELTA push, never the whole export. Edges have no @key, so merge-loading an edge
#     central already has APPENDS a duplicate. Pushing everything gave central 2x edges on
#     every project graph. Nodes are @key(slug) and upsert safely.
#   * NO device branch. `branch create` can hit a Lance internal error ("Clone operation
#     should not enter build_manifest"); `branch merge` of a branch that touched a table
#     main is level with fails ("Concurrent modification: table version N already exists").
#     The branch bought "review before merge", which is meaningless on an unattended timer.
#   * PURGE-then-load for the pull, not `load --mode overwrite`: overwrite into a POPULATED
#     graph trips a Lance bug — and can land anyway while exiting 1, so even its failure is
#     untrustworthy. pull_graph.py handles this (and restores from backup on failure).
#   * Data is piped over STDIN, never bind-mounted. A `mktemp -d` bind mount is mangled by
#     Git Bash, which is why the old version failed on every graph under MSYS.
#   * Every docker invocation's exit code is checked. The old version discarded stderr and
#     `|| true`-d over failures, so a fully failed sync still reported success.
