  sync-windows.ps1 — Windows / Docker Desktop adaptation of omnigraph-sync.sh.

  On Docker Desktop, `--network host` cannot reach the local server on 127.0.0.1,
  so the CLI container runs on the compose network (mcp-server_mcp-net) and
  addresses the LOCAL server as http://omnigraph-server:8080 and the CENTRAL
  server at its public URL. Data is piped over stdin (no bind-mount path issues).

  MULTI-GRAPH: per-project isolation means every project graph must sync, not
  just `memory`. The graphs to sync are discovered like omnigraph-sync.sh:
    - $env:GRAPHS ("a,b" or "a b")            -> exactly that list
    - elseif $env:GRAPH set and != 'memory'   -> that single graph (legacy)
    - else GET {CENTRAL_URL}/graphs            -> every graph_id it returns
  Each graph is reconciled independently; one graph's failure does NOT abort the
  others (the script tracks the last non-zero code and exits with it).

  Guarantees (per graph), matching omnigraph-sync.sh:
    - BACKUP local main first (local is the newest/authoritative copy)
    - push local -> central device/<host> branch -> native merge into central main
    - VERIFY central has no node/edge duplicates before trusting it
    - pull central -> local via OVERWRITE of a deduped export (no dup edges);
      restore from backup if the pull fails
    - VERIFY local; delete the device branch unless -KeepDeviceBranch

  Config: omnigraph-setup/.env or env vars —
    CENTRAL_URL, CENTRAL_TOKEN, LOCAL_TOKEN (required)
    GRAPHS  (comma/space list; default: all graphs central exposes)
    GRAPH   (legacy single non-'memory' graph)      DEVICE (default: hostname)
    VIEWER_URL (e.g. http://coding.vm:8090) — set it and each synced graph is attributed
      to THIS DEVICE in the viewer's Sync log, by the source IP the viewer sees. Unset =
      no attribution; the sync itself is unaffected either way.
    DRY_RUN, KEEP_DEVICE_BRANCH (also the -DryRun / -KeepDeviceBranch switches)
  Run in PowerShell 7 (pwsh). See docs/REMOTE-SYNC-TEST-PLAN.md.

# --- UTF-8 everywhere, before ANY data moves -------------------------------------------
# Omnigraph exports are UTF-8 (JSON always is), but Windows does not default to it and
# every hand-off below is a chance to mangle text:
#   * output of a native command (docker export) is decoded with [Console]::OutputEncoding,
#     which defaults to the OEM code page (cp850). Decoding UTF-8 bytes as cp850 and then
#     writing them back out as UTF-8 is LOSSY — that is real corruption, not a bad compare.
#   * text piped INTO a native command (docker load, python) is encoded with $OutputEncoding
#     — UTF-8 on pwsh 7 but ASCII on Windows PowerShell 5.1, which turns "→" into "?".
#   * Get-Content/Set-Content without -Encoding follow the host default (ANSI on 5.1).
# The sibling bug on the python side made identical nodes look "changed" and re-pushed 52
# of them every run (see _force_utf8_stdio in omnigraph_jsonl.py); these would have been
# worse, because they damage the payload rather than just the comparison.
