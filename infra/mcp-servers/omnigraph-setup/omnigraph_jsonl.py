"""JSONL helpers for Omnigraph sync — guarantee NO node/edge duplicates.

Omnigraph nodes dedupe by @key (slug) on merge, but EDGES are not slug-keyed, so
a naive cross-store export -> load can duplicate edges. This utility dedupes and
verifies a graph export so the sync helpers can enforce "no duplicates after
merge" (see docs/REMOTE-SYNC-TEST-PLAN.md).

Record shapes (NDJSON):
  node: {"type":"<NodeType>","data":{"slug":"...", ...}}
  edge: {"edge":"<EdgeType>","from":"<slug>","to":"<slug>"}

Usage:
  cat graph.jsonl | python3 omnigraph_jsonl.py dedup  > clean.jsonl
  cat graph.jsonl | python3 omnigraph_jsonl.py verify        # exit 1 if duplicates
  cat local.jsonl | python3 omnigraph_jsonl.py pushset central.jsonl > push.jsonl

    Two independent reasons this must be a delta and not the whole export:

    1. Edges have no `@key`, so merge-loading an edge central already has APPENDS a second
       copy; the branch-merge then carries the duplicate into main. Pushing everything is
       exactly how central got 2x edges on every project graph (2026-07-17).
    2. Pushing a node that is *identical* to central's still bumps that table's version on
       the device branch, and the branch-merge then fails with
       `Concurrent modification: table version N already exists for node:<Type>` — the
       merge cannot fast-forward because main is already at N. So an unchanged node is not
       harmless: it breaks the whole sync.

    Emit a node only when central lacks the slug or its payload actually differs
    (ignoring VOLATILE fields); emit an edge only when central lacks it. An empty result
    means "nothing to push" — the caller should skip the branch entirely.

    Omnigraph exports are UTF-8 (JSON always is). Python, however, decodes stdin with the

    with `encoding="utf-8"` a few lines up. So the SAME text arrived as two unequal
    strings, and `pushset` dutifully reported every node containing an em dash, an arrow
    or an umlaut as "changed" — 52 of basic-analysis's 135 nodes, on every single run,
    forever. Nothing was corrupted (a cp1252 decode/encode round-trip is byte-lossless),
    but each run re-pushed those nodes to central for no reason.

    Fixing this in the script rather than by exporting PYTHONIOENCODING at each call site
    keeps the guarantee with the code that needs it: this file is also run by hand, by
    systemd, and by the Task Scheduler, and only one of those would have carried the env.
