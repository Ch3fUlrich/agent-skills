<#
  setup-sync.ps1 — configure + schedule the Omnigraph local<->central sync (Windows).

  The Windows twin of setup-sync.sh. One command from "the stack is running" to "memory
  syncs every 5 minutes":
    1. derive what it can (LOCAL_TOKEN from ..\.env.shared, DOCKER_NET + the two local URLs
       from the RUNNING containers, DEVICE from the hostname)
    2. write omnigraph-setup\.env, MERGING rather than clobbering
    3. register a Scheduled Task
    4. prove it with a DRY RUN before anything is scheduled

  WHY IT MERGES INSTEAD OF WRITING FRESH: the one value that cannot be derived is
  CENTRAL_TOKEN — central's bearer is NOT the local one in .env.shared (they are different
  secrets). An earlier setup script in this directory overwrote a good .env with a template
  and cost the operator their credentials. An existing value always wins over a derived one,
  and nothing here writes an empty over a non-empty. Re-running is safe by construction.

  Usage:
    .\setup-sync.ps1                                  # derive, merge, schedule, dry-run
    .\setup-sync.ps1 -CentralUrl https://… -CentralToken abc…
    .\setup-sync.ps1 -NoSchedule                      # config + dry-run only
    .\setup-sync.ps1 -IntervalMinutes 15              # default 5
    .\setup-sync.ps1 -Show                            # print resolved config, change nothing
    .\setup-sync.ps1 -Unregister                      # remove the Scheduled Task
